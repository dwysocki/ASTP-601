# Definitions

Dispersion delay: Time delay between different frequencies.

$$\left(\frac{t}{\rm sec}\right) \approx 4.149 \times 10^3 \left(\frac{DM}{\rm pc\ cm^{-3}}\right) \left(\frac{\nu}{\rm MHz}\right)^{-2}$$

Disperesion measure: number of electrons along line of sight.

$$DM = \int_0^d n_e d{\ell}$$
