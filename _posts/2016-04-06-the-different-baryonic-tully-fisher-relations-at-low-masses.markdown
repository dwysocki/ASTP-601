"The different baryonic Tully-Fisher relations at low masses" by C. B. Brook, I. Santos-Santos, and G. Stinson

<http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06595>


# Summary

There have been a number of papers lately focusing on the low-mass end of the BTFR, biases in mass and velocity measurements, and their effect on the overall relation. This paper uses the MaGICC simulated galaxies to generate fake observations. The simulation is based on Î›CDM.

See Figure 2 on page 4 for some simulated rotation curves. See Figure 3 on page 5 for some simulated HI line profiles.

See Figure 5 on page 6. Each type of velocity measurement gives a slightly different BTFR. Consistent with many previous papers, the biggest discrepancies occur at the low velocity/mass end of the relation.
