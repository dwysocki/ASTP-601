# Summary

B-Cephei are pulsating variable stars (not to be confused with Cepheids). They are high mass stars (7-20 solar masses) which span from main sequence to the transition to blue supergiants. Their periods are short (on the order of a few hours) and they change over time. The rate of period change can be tied into stellar evolution models.

This paper compares published rates of period change with rates predicted by models. 8 stars are used, only 2 of which could be used to find stellar parameters from, due to the rates being too small or large.


## Methodology

Compare measured rates with model predictions. Model is based on period-mean density relation (P sqrt(rho) = Q). Equation 1 (page 2) gives the differential equation derived from this.


## Tables

Table 1 (page 2) shows period changes from literature.

Table 2 (page 4) shows stellar parameters obtained.


## Figures

Figure 1 (page 3) shows stellar evolution tracks for different stars with different assumptions made on the unknown parameters. Left plot assumes constant [core overshoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_overshoot) varies initial rotation rates, while right plot assumes zero rotation and varies core overshoot.

**Figure out what Figure 2 means**


## Results

Predicted rates of change versus observed rates are not in agreement.

Suggests evolution of B-cepheids is more complex than expected. May also be the case that period-mean density relation is not constant throughout the star for all times, which was assumed by the model.
